# 🧠 Portfolio-MachineLearning-DeepLearning — *Kentin Guillemot*

## 🎯 Overview

This portfolio showcases a collection of **real-world AI and Data Science projects**, developed during my **Master’s in Data & Artificial Intelligence (ESILV)** and my professional work as an AI Engineer.
Each directory represents a specific **area of applied AI**, from traditional machine learning to modern deep learning and computer vision.

The goal is to demonstrate a **complete understanding of the AI lifecycle** — from data preprocessing and model training to interpretability and deployment.
